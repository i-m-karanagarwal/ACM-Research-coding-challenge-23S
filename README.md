Problem 1: I tried to find out a safe region where a planet should be located around the star which supports the habitable life.

The results may not be that accurate but it may save a lot of time while searching for habitable planets. {1} have given the equation wich I have used to find the inner and outer boundaries of the safe region.

I have appended the result in the csv file provided.
